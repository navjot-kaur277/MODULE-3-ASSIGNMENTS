# React Conditional Styling Lab

A professional, high-fidelity React application demonstrating state management and dynamic UI updates. This project toggles a component's theme between "Red" and "Blue" states using modern React hooks and CSS best practices.

## 🚀 Features
- **State-Driven UI**: Uses `useState` to manage component behavior.
- **Dynamic Styling**: Implements conditional `className` logic for theme switching.
- **Premium UX**: Includes smooth CSS transitions, glassmorphism button effects, and tactile rotation transforms.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully centered layout using Flexbox that works on all screen sizes.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation
As per the task requirements, the project achieves the following:
- **Initial State**: The component renders in a "Red" state by default.
- **Toggle Logic**: A button allows the user to switch seamlessly between Red and Blue modes.
- **Boolean Logic**: The state is stored as a boolean, driving the conditional logic for both text and styles.
